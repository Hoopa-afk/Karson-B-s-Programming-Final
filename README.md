This is where the hardest part comes in, making a final class project...
This is the toughest project I have ever made, and it's just a simple pet simulator, that says something more about me.

A virtual pet game built with Pygame where you care for your pet by feeding, cleaning, and playing with it. Watch it grow, monitor its mood, and don’t forget to clean up its poop! Seriously, it's gross.

## 📦Features
- **Care system:** Feed, play, and clean your pet to keep it alive and happy  
- **Growth system:** Your pet evolves once after 30 seconds of care  
- **Mood system:** Pet shows different moods based on its stats  
- **Death mechanic:** If any stat reaches 0, the pet dies
