# Title
Hungry Tomogatchi Project!

## Repository
<https://github.com/Hoopa-afk/Karson-B-s-Programming-Final.git>

## Description
With this little creature, you can feed it, and help it avoid starving by eating some more. This will involve pressing a button to create a command. Creating a system that allows inputs to create one action will be the main function.

## Features
- Feature 1
	- Feeding the creature. Pressing a specific button will allow you to feed it.
- Feature 2
	- This project will feature a vibrant background, a setting like a house, this will help with emersion.
- Feature 3
	- Petting! You can pet your little buddy as a second buttom command.

## Challenges
- I need to implement a system where a specific action is used, mutlple in this case like feeding and petting.
- This project will most likely use pygame and pillow, I can use my images, or create sprites.
- This isn't something that is particularly researchable but I want this project to have a sense of polish!

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- Ideally, This little project will be a fun game for people who like watching little guys walk around, and being able to feed it.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- For the bare minimum, you can pet it, (hopefully I can do everything I'm looking for.)

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Creating sprites or pictures of the creature Also creating a UI that tells the player what they can do.
  2. Creating a background for the creature.

- Week 2
  1. Start to create the pet mechanic, this is a simple one, so I will start on this one first.
  2. Implement animations of the creature walking around, to make it seem lively instead of it starring you down. This will probably be the hardest feature to add.

- Week N (Final)
  1. Start to implement the feeding button, creating a system where the action is created and the creature is being fed. This will be the second hardest thing to add.
  2. Add the finishing touches and run tests to make sure it's functioning propelly. Adding anything else that needs to be added or fixed.
